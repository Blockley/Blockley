              <h2>The UGLE Universities Scheme</h2>
              <p>Tradition and continuity are two of the values which characterise the relationship between Freemasonry and universities. It was over 200 years ago that the first university Lodge, Apollo University Lodge, was founded at Oxford, with Isaac Newton University Lodge following soon afterwards in&nbsp;Cambridge.</p>
              <p>The UGLE Universities Scheme was set up in 2005 and there are now 85 Scheme Lodges in total. Their membership consists of undergraduates, postgraduates, senior members of the university and alumni, ranging in age from 18 upwards. All under-25s benefit from a 50% reduction in membership fees make Freemasonry as accessible to as wide an audience as&nbsp;possible</p>
              <p>Blockley Lodge became the Universities Scheme Lodge for Oxford Brookes University in 2016 and we are always keen to hear from potential joiners, whether you are a student or staff member at Oxford&nbsp;Brookes.</p>
